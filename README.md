## Dev notes

If you wish to contribute, note that most of the functionality is still very dependent to tombrunberg/vue-event-calendar. 
I might merge these repositories into one later on, but for now VEC is more of a customized plugin around rest of the functionalities.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
